# Dice_Roller
A simple Python-based Dice Roller application that simulates rolling a dice using random number generation. The program generates a random number between 1 and 6 each time it runs, mimicking a real dice roll. It is useful for beginners to understand Python concepts such as loops, functions, and the random module.
